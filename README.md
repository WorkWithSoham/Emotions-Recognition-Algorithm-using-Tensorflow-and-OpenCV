# Emotions-Recognition-Algorithm-using-Tensorflow-and-OpenCV
Machine Learning Project based in Kaggle's Emotions Dataset

Kaggle Facial Expression Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/facial-expression-detection-cnn

Haar Cascades XML file: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

=> Run the emo_det.py file first!
=> You may make changes to your model for better accuracy!
=> This project when built worked on a 75% accuracy!
